# Hyperskill_Kotlin_IndigoCardGame

This was the third project I completed as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as a hard difficulty project. It asks the student to program the card game "Indigo". 
The focus of this project was on types, null safety, and polymorphism within kotlin.
It also had some sections touching briefly on algorithms, pseudocode, and big O notation.

Looking back at this, I remember being frustrated with how I had handled the computer's AI. At the time it seemed a bit cluttered and unclear. 
I spent lots of time trying to find "the perfect way" to get the program to do what it needed to, but eventually conceded that it was more important to get a working program.

I have also included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
